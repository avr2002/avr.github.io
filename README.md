## **Projects**

### **NLP Projects**
- **Fake News Classification** | [GitHub](https://github.com/avr2002/Fake-News-Classification-using-RNN-and-LSTM/blob/main/notebooks/main_notebook-2.ipynb)
    - **Technologies Used: `Python`, `TensorFlow`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `langdetect`, `wordcloud`, `matplotlib`, `regex`, `numpy`, `pandas`**
    - Implemented an **LSTM Model** on [Kaggle Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification) with over 70K news text data, with **97% accuracy**
    - Along with standard text pre-processing, langdetect library was used to identify & remove news in other languages(French, German, Arabic, etc.) giving better model performance.
    - For EDA, WordCloud, and plotting of bi-grams and tri-grams were used to identify the general words present in the corpus.
    - **LSTM Model** was build using **TensorFlow** along with pre-trained **GloVe Word Embeddings**.

- **Topic Modeling Using RACE Dataset** | [GitHub](https://github.com/avr2002/Topic-Modelling-Using-RACE-Dataset)
  - **Technologies Used:  `Python`, `Regex`, `NLTK`, `Gensim`, `Scikit-Learn`, `tSNE`, `pyLDAvis`, `bokeh`, `Git`**
  - This **NLP Project** aims to use statistical models to reveal the abstract “topics” present in a large set of text documents, thus trying to classify documents based on different themes they convey.
  - Three **Topic Modeling algorithms** were used namely, **Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization(NMF)**.
  - **BERTopic** & **Top2Vec** were also explored which gave quite good results.


- **Medical Embeddings and Clinical Trial Search Engine** | [Github](https://github.com/avr2002/Medical-Embeddings-and-Clinical-Trial-Search-Engine)
  - **Technologies Used: `Python`, `Gensim`, `Word2Vec`, `FastText`, `Streamlit`, `Git`**
  - The Project aims to train SkipGram and FastText Models on COVID-19 Clinical Trials Dataset and builds a Search Engine where user can type any COVID-19 related keyword and it presents all the top n similar results from the dataset
