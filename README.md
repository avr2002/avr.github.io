## **Projects**

### **NLP Projects**
- **Fake News Classification** | [GitHub](https://github.com/avr2002/Fake-News-Classification-using-RNN-and-LSTM/blob/main/notebooks/main_notebook-2.ipynb)
    - **Technologies Used: `Python`, `TensorFlow`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `langdetect`, `wordcloud`, `matplotlib`, `regex`, `numpy`, `pandas`**
    - Implemented an **LSTM Model** on [Kaggle Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification) with over 70K news text data, with **97% accuracy**
    - Along with standard text pre-processing, langdetect library was used to identify & remove news in other languages(French, German, Arabic, etc.) giving better model performance.
    - For EDA, WordCloud, and plotting of bi-grams and tri-grams were used to identify the general words present in the corpus.
    - **LSTM Model** was build using **TensorFlow** along with pre-trained **GloVe Word Embeddings**.

- **Topic Modeling Using RACE Dataset** | [GitHub](https://github.com/avr2002/Topic-Modelling-Using-RACE-Dataset)
  - **Technologies Used:  `Python`, `Regex`, `NLTK`, `Gensim`, `Scikit-Learn`, `tSNE`, `pyLDAvis`, `bokeh`, `Git`**
  - This **NLP Project** aims to use statistical models to reveal the abstract ‚Äútopics‚Äù present in a large set of text documents, thus trying to classify documents based on different themes they convey.
  - Three **Topic Modeling algorithms** were used namely, **Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization(NMF)**.
  - **BERTopic** & **Top2Vec** were also explored which gave quite good results.


- **Medical Embeddings and Clinical Trial Search Engine** | [Github](https://github.com/avr2002/Medical-Embeddings-and-Clinical-Trial-Search-Engine)
  - **Technologies Used: `Python`, `Gensim`, `Word2Vec`, `FastText`, `Streamlit`, `Git`**
  - The Project aims to train SkipGram and FastText Models on COVID-19 Clinical Trials Dataset and builds a Search Engine where user can type any COVID-19 related keyword and it presents all the top n similar results from the dataset

### **Computer Vision Projects**
- **Image Coloring using Autoencoders** | [Github](https://github.com/avr2002/Image-Coloring-using-Autoencoders)
    - **Technologies Used: `Python`, `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `scikit-image`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`**
    -  I tried using Autoencoders and Transfer Learning for this one. I tried VGG16 and InceptionResNetV2 as an encoder/feature extractor layer and a custom decoder layer.


- **Muti-class Image Classification Model** | [Github](https://github.com/avr2002/Image-Classification-CNN-Model-for-Real-Time-Prediction)
    - **Technologies Used: `Python`, `tensorflow`, `keras`, `matplotlib`, `flask`, `gunicorn`, `pathlib`, `numpy`**
    - The project aims to classify images into driving license, social security, and others category by using a CNN model architecture.
    - An accuracy of 96% was achieved on test data of 150 images. Deployment was done using gunicorn and flask API.

### **Machine Learning & Python Projects** 

- **Business License Status Prediction** | [GitHub](https://github.com/avr2002/Business-License-Status-Prediction)
  - **Technologies Used: `Python, scikit-learn, h2o, tensorflow, flask, gunicorn`**
  - The project aims to predict if a customer's license should be issued, renewed, or cancelled depending on features in the dataset. The problem statement was presented at [ZS Data Science Challenge - 2019](https://www.interviewbit.com/contest/zs-yds-2019/).


- **Medical Data Extraction Project** | [Github](https://github.com/avr2002/medical-data-extraction-project)
  - **Technologies Used: `Python, Regex, OpenCV, Pytesseract, FastAPI`**
  - Python backend was built using pytesseract, OpenCV, Regular expressions and FastAPI as a web serving framework
  - Auto extracted important fields from patient details and medical prescriptions. Image processing was performed in OpenCV and then pytesseract was used for image to text conversion. The last step was to use Regular Expression (Regex) for extracting important fields from the text


- **SQL Project: Provide Insights to Management in Consumer Goods Domain**
    - [Project Github Link](https://github.com/avr2002/sql-project-consumer-goods-domain) & [Certificate of Participation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QdbMXJoyvD8SASKbZYQelT-uQamhiEQ4/view?usp=share_link)
    

- **Credit Card Default Prediction** | [Github](https://github.com/avr2002/credit-card-default-prediction)
    - This a classic Credit Card Default Prediction project where based on customer profile we want to predict whether the borrower is likely to default in the next 2 years or not have a delinquency of more than 3 months.
    - LogisticRegression, RandomForst, XGBoost, LightGBM, and a vanilla Neural Network was implemented in modeling.


- **Regression Models for House Price Prediction** | [GitHub](https://github.com/avr2002/Regression-Models-for-House-Price-Prediction)
    - House Price Prediction on Pune Real-estate dataset using different regression models like Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, Random Forest, XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Regressor, XGBoost.
    - Also, multi-layer perceptron(MLP) was implemented using TensorFlow
