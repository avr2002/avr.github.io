## Projects
- **Medical Embeddings and Clinical Trial Search Engine** [Github](https://github.com/avr2002/Medical-Embeddings-and-Clinical-Trial-Search-Engine)
  - **Technologies Used: Python, Gensim, Word2Vec, FastText, Streamlit**
  - The Project aims to train SkipGram and FastText Models on COVID-19 Clinical Trials Dataset and builds a Search Engine where user can type any COVID-19 related keyword and it presents all the top n similar results from the dataset

- Medical Data Extraction Project [Github](https://github.com/avr2002/medical-data-extraction-project)
  - **Technologies Used: Python, Regex, OpenCV, Pytesseract**
  - Python backend was built using pytesseract, OpenCV, Regular expressions and FastAPI as a web serving framework
  - Auto extracted important fields from patient details and medical prescriptions. Image processing was performed in OpenCV and then pytesseract was used for image to text conversion. The last step was to use Regular Expression (Regex) for extracting important fields from the text
